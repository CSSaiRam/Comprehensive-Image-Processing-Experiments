• Estimated dense optical flow between video frames using FlowNet architecture and block matching techniques.

• Created image illusions using frequency domain filtering. Computed the disparity map from the given stereo pairs.

• Created and augmented handwritten Bengali MNIST dataset and observed the effects of transfer learning on results.
